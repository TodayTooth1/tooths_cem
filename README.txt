cem path is required to make entity models custom
both the .jem file and the texture file must be placed within the cem folder
a <entity.name>.properties file can be used to specify required nbt tags
    you can use the same model for multiple names
        EXAMPLE:
        models.2 = 2
        name.2 = Scuba
        models.3 = 2
        name.3 = Percy
        ect....
    Note: models.2 = <#>
        the <#> would correspond to <#> in the .jem file you want to use
        i.e {wolf2.jem} would result in {models.2 = 2} using the wolf2 entity model
